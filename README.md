# ONGOING PROJECTS
## Projects that have been started and not finished and could be worked on. Most projects contain a readme that contains instruction on the next steps to take.
### 1. [NeoPixel Controller](https://github.com/Lathomas42/NeoPixelController)
### 2. [Vibration Monitor](https://github.com/Lathomas42/VibrationMonitor)
### 3. Tension Tester
the tension tester is almost complete with the code pretty much done. This tests the slip clutch for the samurai 2. A sample drawing that shows how to calculate tension from the force measured is included as well.
Using ADComando (the loadcell branch) turn the motor to increase tension on the tape, and watch the output tension. The motor will output a certain maximum tension depending on how the slip clutch is adjusted. 

Improvements include gluing many of the acrylic pieces together to allow for a tighter fix and no unnecessary friction with the tape against the wheel.
### 4. Samurai 2
Samurai 2 is almost fully built, but requires the driving motor to be run by the ADComando arduino and maybe putting in a new slip clutch / testing said slip clutch.

1. swap current bigEasy driver to ADComando L6470 Autodriver.
2. test slip clutch using rig to get the tension required (ask Brett for exact numbers)
3. Use ADComando to write a script to control the movement of the tape along the samurai and verify that it moves in set increments and passes any precision tests using the point grey camera.
### 5. [Overlap Calculations / Synapse probability](https://github.com/Lathomas42/OverlapCalculations)
Finding the "right" metric to use for synapse probability
